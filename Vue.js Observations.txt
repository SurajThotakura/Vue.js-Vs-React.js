Vue.js observations 


Before starting Vue.js I was familiar with HTML CSS and Vanilla JavaScript but never applied JavaScript extensively. 

It took me one working day to learn, experiment and build a minimum confidence on Vue.js. 

It took me one working day to build this pagination component. 

 

Setting up Vue.js was very straightforward. 

The documentation was very organised, everything was properly categorised. It was helpful to look for specific applications of Vue.js. 

The order of these categories was according to, the complexity and significance of the application. It allowed simultaneous learning and applying the concepts. 

One doesn't have to know about how everything is working in order to start building applications, as there were ways to implement vanilla JavaScript and HTML directly. 

There was limited support from the community, the number of solutions for a problem and number of problems itself were less, but they were sufficiently informative. 

Vue dev tools chrome extension was very helpful to debug and check how data was interpreted.

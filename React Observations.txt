React observations

 
Before starting React I was familiar with HTML CSS and Vanilla JavaScript but never applied JavaScript extensively. However, I built the same component using Vue.js.


Even though I didn't study all the concepts of react I was able to build a basic component by using following concepts 

  * JSX 

  * Components and Props 

  * State and Lifecycle 

  * Handling Events 

  * Conditional Rendering 


Setting up was not as straightforward as Vue.js as react didnâ€™t offer a CLI. However, facebook provides an environment that comes pre-configured with everything you need to build a React app. 


Even though the official documentation did not cover all the applications and special cases of the concepts there were plenty of Q/As on many forums which were helpful. 


React dev tools chrome extension was very helpful to debug and check how data was interpreted. 


Overall the learning curve is considerably steep compared to Vue.js but was not a hinderance to learn and apply the concepts quickly.
